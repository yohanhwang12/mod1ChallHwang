### Overview and Origin

<p> The company I chose for this module was Opendoor. Opendoor is a real estate company that makes moving easier for homeowners. According to its webpage on investor relations, they "set out to reinvent lifeâ€™s most important transaction with a new, radically simple way to buy and sell your home.  We have rebuilt the entire consumer real estate experience and have made buying and selling possible on a mobile device." The company was started in 2014 by Eric Wu and Ian Wong. Eric is currently president and is responsible for all of the business side of the company while Ian is Chief Technology Officer and leads teams of engineers to create and maintain a platform that fits a modern real estate industry. The company is currently headquartered in San Francisco.</p>

### Business Activities

<p> Opendoor was created to facilitate the moving process for homeowners. It is easy for renters to move given that they don't have many commitments to the place they dwell in except for their rental lease, which can always be broken for a small penalty. However, when a homeowner wants to move, they have to put their home on the market. This is usually a very cumbersome process that can take months to complete. There are some who have wanted to move but in the end decided not to because their home was an impediment. </p>

<p> So why does it traditionally take so long for someone to sell a home and why is the process so cumbersome? Well, to start with one needs to hire a real estate agent. The main reason why this is necessary is because brokers have access to the Multiple Listing Service, which is the main online database of homes on the market where companies like Zillow or Redfin pull their homes from. People understand that their homes need to be online because in the internet age, no one will come around knocking with a simple "For Sale" sign on the yard. Then the agent uses her expertise to make recommendations as to how to stage the house, paint walls a certain color, make some updates, landscape the place, etc. Then professional photographers are brought in, and the home goes online. The process of updating a house alone could take months, depending on what it needs. One sometimes has to take a risk hiring a contractor they don't know. Contractors are also busy and can't make the updates right away. Sometimes appliances or cabinets are backordered. After that lenghty process, once the house is online it usually does not sell right away. If mispriced, it could take a couple months to find a commmitted buyer. And once the contract is signed, then it could take a couple months to close on the deal, which could always fall apart because the buyer is not happy after inspection or because the lender of the buyer does not approve, in which case, the process starts over.</p>

<p>The core of the business of Opendoor is to take the brunt of the process themselves by making direct offers to sellers. In other words, no painting, fixing, hiring contractors, photographers, and no dealing with buyers or lenders that may change their minds. Though Opendoor has many other ancillary services, this is the core of their business. An analogy is the car dealership. If someone wanted to switch cars and they first had to put his car on the market, he or she would have to make a few repairs, have the car washed, etc. And only cash buyers would be acceptable. On the other hand, one can go to a car dealership and simply trade in her car. Voila! Car is replaced with no hassle! But this obviously means that the seller gets less for the car than if selling oneself. Same for those who sell to Opendoor. This seamless process using online technology has become as home ibuying in the press and media.</p>

<p>Opendoor harnesses the power of technology to provide the services they do. The key here is about valuing homes appropriately. If they offered very low prices to sellers, no one would sign up and the company would have no customers. On the other hand if they offered too high a price, the company would not be able to generate profits. Opendoor uses a combination of machine learning and data science to reduce their margin of error on their valuations. They also use "ensembling," which is combining appropriately the valuations provided by different models. So they don't just rely on one model built by their machine learning, but various.</p>

### The Business Landscape

<p>As mentioned previously, Opendoor has the potential to disrupt the entire real estate industry. In some ways all traditional real estate brokerages are their competitors. So are traditional flippers. Flippers are often just small businesses that offer to buy homes with cash, improve the home and sell them for a higher price. This is exactly what Opendoor does but traditional flippers do not have the benefit of technology with them. Opendoor prides itself in being able to offer higher prices to sellers than traditional flippers.</p>

<p>But the closest competitors are those in the home ibuying business. The biggest one was Zillow. Zillow was trying to do exactly the same as Opendoor but failed and had to fold that part of their business.
Zillow was relying on something they thought they had mastered, the Zestimate, or their algorithmic valuation of properties they had started all they way from 2006. But the pandemic gave a lot of volatility to house prices and the Zestimates became inaccurate. It was so bad that according to Wired, "nine in 10 homes Zillow bought were put up for sale at a lower price than the company originally bought them." With Zillow as their main competitor gone, Opendoor market share went up dramatically.</p>

### Results

<p>This is no doubt a company that is trying to disrupt the entire real estate market. Clearly many consumers have bought in to the convenience that Opendoor offers. The Wall Street Journal projects that Opendoor will soon have 79% of home ibuying market share. This new way of selling one's home is growing in popularity as Opendoor's revenue grew 211% in 2021 to $8 billion according to Nasdaq. However, it remains to be seen whether this growth and success is sustainable. Their recent success could have been merely a product of the failure of their main competitor, Zillow.</p>

### Recommendations

<p>Clearly, Opendoor's valuation technology turned out to be superior to Zillow's, which allowed it to outlast its main competitor. I'm not sure how much their tech side of the business could improve, as this is a complex topic and they have clearly come out as winners on this one.</p>

<p>However, based on their current business model, their growth will eventually hit a wall. This is because there will always be many home sellers who prefer to keep as much money for themselves as possible. They are savvy enough to understand that tens of thousands of dollars, if not hundreds, are at stake. So they prefer to go through the work of fixing their home and go the traditional way. There are even ways to save on the real estate commission as there are a few brokerages that are fee based rather than percentage based. Of course, this would mean that the seller himself is responsible for showing the house around, but many sellers are willing to go through the trouble to save tens of thousands. This is the reason why these sellers never went to traditional flippers, which were around way before Opendoor.</p>

<p>The question is, how does one convince those sellers that the service is worth it? Perhaps one way is for the company to offer tiered levels of service. They can keep doing what they do as one tier for those who want the most convenience. But at another tier, they could offer to share a percentage of profits after the house sells. So for instance, if Opendoor estimates a home to be worth $200,000 in its current condition, and they estimate that if they put in $20,000 to freshen it up, and that adds $40,000 of value, then if all goes well, the house should sell for $240,000 with a profit of $20,000. What if the company offered to split that profit with the seller? But in return, unlike the first tiered service, the seller would not get the cash immediately but until the house actually sells. It would be like a middle ground between a traditional brokerage and the convenience of the current service that Opendoor offers.</p>

<p>All in all, Opendoor has a good business proposition and is bound to grow for the next several years.</p>
